# FilewaveDEP
Files that define our DEP onboarding process

FilewaveBootstrap.py is used to name the computer.  The user chooses their Location, Department and Role from the Drop down menus.  Then FWBS appends that to the serial number of the device.  After the Mac is named, Filewave is downloaded and installed.

bootstrap.json is used as a package manifest instructing InstallApplications what to download from our webserver.

role_map.json Defines our locations, departments and roles chosen from the FilewaveBootstrap.py
